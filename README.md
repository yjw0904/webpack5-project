Get Started
Make sure to run on Node version 14.4.0. If Node Version Manager is installed, ensure version 14.4.0 is installed and run nvm use which will run off of the nvm config file .nvmrc.
To start the server, do npm run start. The server run on port 8080.
To build, do npm rum build. This will create the dist folder with the bundled assets.
